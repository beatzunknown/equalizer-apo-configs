# Equalizer APO Configurations

Just a safe storage for my mic + headphones EQ.

For the most part, the headphone configs are going to be Parametric EQs (as Peace files) that have been modified versions of what can be found in the epic [AutoEq](https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq/tree/master/results) repo. Personally I find the Harman targets these settings try to aim for make the audio signature a bit too thin for my liking so I've basically just turned off the bass/mid-bass low-shelf and peaking filters while keeping the rest as is. In some cases I have stuck with true Harman and in others I have made some adjustments. I'm learning to make my own EQ profiles now, so some may also be entirely custom.

## Headphones

My personal target for open back headphones is generally the HD 6XX. For closed back headphones I tend for more bass, opting for the Super OE target with a +5dB low shelf filter at round 150Hz.

* Sennheiser HD6XX/650 - `hd6xx_to_hd600.txt` - `hd6xx_to_hd600.peace`

* AKG K175 - `k175.txt` - `k175.peace`

* Sony WH1000XM3 - `xm3.txt` - `xm3.peace`

* Focal Clear - TBC

### IEMs

My personal target for IEMs tends to be somewhere between IEF Neutral and Harman 2019 IEM target. Harman for bass + midrange, IEF Neutral for upper midrange, presence and treble.

EQ profiles assume using Spinfit tips (CP 145) unless otherwise stated.
