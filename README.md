# Equalizer APO Configurations

Just a safe storage for my mic + headphones EQ.

For the most part, the headphone configs are going to be Parametric EQs (as Peace files) that have been modified versions of what can be found in the epic [AutoEq](https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq/tree/master/results) repo. Personally I find the Harman targets these settings try to aim for make the audio signature a bit too thin for my liking so I've basically just turned off the bass/mid-bass low-shelf and peaking filters while keeping the rest as is. In some cases I have stuck with true Harman and in others I have made some adjustments.

The root of this repo contains Parametric EQ txt's for easy usage with applications like Poweramp. The mapping of txts to the exact Peace config are as follows:

* `cra.txt` - `cra_to_z1r.peace`

* `hd6xx.txt` - `hd6xx_to_hd600.peace`

* `ie80s.txt` - `ie80s_oratory_10band_boosted.peace`

* `k175.txt` - `k175.peace`

* `xm3.txt` - `xm3_harman_boosted.peace`
