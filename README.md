# Equalizer APO Configurations

Just a safe storage for my mic + headphones EQ.

For the most part, the headphone configs are going to be Parametric EQs that have been modified versions of what can be found in the epic [AutoEq](https://github.com/jaakkopasanen/AutoEq/tree/master/results) repo. Personally I find the Harman targets these settings try to aim for make the audio signature a bit too thin for my liking so I've basically just turned off the bass/mid-bass low-shelf and peaking filters while keeping the rest as is.
